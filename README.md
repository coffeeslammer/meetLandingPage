## Overview

This one started easy but when I got to the desktop version I came across an issue with the header pictures. I was using the picture element but discovered I can't load two pictures separately. So I have to rethink my strategy. I decided to use background-image in css to fix the problem. After that it went well.

### What I learned

I've been learning how to use the ::before and ::after. A little bit more on background-images.
